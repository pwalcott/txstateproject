        <h1>Georgia History</h1>
        <p>
          In many ways Georgia's history is integrally linked to that of the rest of the South and the rest of the nation. But as
          the largest state east of the Mississippi, the youngest and southernmost of the thirteen colonies, and by 1860 the most
          populous southern state, Georgia is in certain respects historically distinctive (Cobb, 2020).
        </p>
        <h3>Colonial and Revolutionary Georgia</h3>
        <p>
          Georgia's colonial experience was very different from that of the other British colonies in North America. Established
          in 1732, with settlement in Savannah in 1733, Georgia was the last of the thirteen colonies to be founded. Its formation
          came a half-century after the twelfth British colony, Pennsylvania, was chartered (in 1681) and seventy years after
          South Carolina's founding (in 1663). Georgia was the only colony founded and ruled by a Board of Trustees, which was
          based in London, England, with no governor or governing body within the colony itself for the first two decades of its
          existence. Perhaps most striking, Georgia was the only one of the North American colonies in which slavery was
          explicitly banned at the outset, along with rum, lawyers, and Catholics. (Jews did not receive explicit permission from
          the Trustees to join the colony but were allowed to stay upon their arrival in 1733.) Rum was eventually legalized in
          1742 and slavery in 1751, marking the weakening of Trustee rule. The colony was governed by royally appointed governors
          instead of a council of Trustees from 1752 to 1776, ending with the outbreak of the Revolutionary War (Cobb, 2020).
