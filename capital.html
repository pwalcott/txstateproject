        <h1>Atlanta</h1>
        <p>Atlanta is the capital of Georgia, the state's largest city, and the seat of Fulton County.</p>
        <p>According to the 2020 U.S. census, the population of Atlanta is 498,715, although the metropolitan area
          (comprising
          twenty-eight counties and more than 6,000 square miles) has a population of more than 6 million. It is also
          one of the
          most important commercial, financial, and transportation centers of the southeastern United States. Located in
          the
          northern portion of the state, Atlanta enjoys a high mean elevation - 1,050 feet (320m) above sea level -
          which
          distinguishes it from most other southern (and eastern) cities and contributes to a more temperate climate
          than is
          found in areas farther south (Ambrose, 2004).</p>
